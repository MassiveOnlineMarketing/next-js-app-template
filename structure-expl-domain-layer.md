In the domain layer of a software application, especially within the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture, entities and services serve distinct but complementary roles:

## Entities

**Definition:** Entities are objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. An entity is defined not by its attributes, but by a thread of continuity and identity (e.g., a user with a unique ID).

**Characteristics:**
- **Identity:** Entities are primarily identified by their identity, rather than their attributes. For example, two users might have the same name and date of birth, but they are distinct entities because they have different unique identifiers.
- **Mutability:** Entities can change over time. Their attributes might change, but their identity remains constant.
- **Encapsulation of Business Rules:** Entities often encapsulate business rules that are applicable to them. For instance, a User entity might have methods to change its state, validate its state, or perform operations that are intrinsic to the concept of a user in the application.

**Usage:** Used to model concepts in the business domain that have a clear identity and lifecycle. Examples include User, Order, Product, etc.

## Services

**Definition:** In DDD, a domain service is a stateless object that encapsulates business logic which doesn't naturally fit within the boundary of an entity or value object. Services are used to perform operations, calculations, or transformations that are domain-specific.

**Characteristics:**
- **Statelessness:** Services do not hold state. They are mechanisms to perform operations or calculations based on inputs, often involving one or more entities or value objects.
- **Focus on Actions:** Services are defined by the actions they perform or the operations they facilitate. For example, a PaymentProcessingService might handle the logic to process payments, interacting with entities such as Order and PaymentDetails but not storing any state of its own.
- **Encapsulation of Business Logic:** Services encapsulate business logic that does not naturally belong to an entity. This includes operations that involve multiple entities or where putting the logic inside an entity would violate the single responsibility principle.

**Usage:** Used when an operation or business rule does not logically belong to any single entity. Examples include AuthenticationService, PaymentProcessingService, or OrderFulfillmentService.

## Domain


## Summary

Entities are about being; they represent things with identity and lifecycle in your domain. Services are about doing; they represent actions, operations, or processes involving entities and value objects. This separation helps maintain a clean, organized domain model that clearly reflects the business domain, adhering to principles like single responsibility and separation of concerns.
